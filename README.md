# Nucats-Codeathon-2019

### Description

Repository featuring CTF challenges created during the *NUCATS Codeathon 2019* at Newcastle University.

Each challenge is further described within its corresponding directory, as well as provides a *Solution* folder with solutions to each challenge (textual information and optionally code to fully automate solving the challenge).

### Challenges

The challenges are mainly focused on *Cryptography* and *Forensics*, however general knowledge still applies. Some useful ideas to know about are *recursion*, file compression*, *substitution ciphers*, *dictionary ciphers*, *music theory*, *steganography*, *image processing*, and, naturally, *programming*.
