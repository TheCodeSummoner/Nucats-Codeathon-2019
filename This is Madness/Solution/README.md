### Description

To obtain the solution, follow the steps:

1. Recursively extract zipped folder.

2. Recursively decrypt the text file using *base64* and *binary* formats.

3. Find the flag (where *300 Spartans* takes place) -> *Thermopylae*

### Extras

1. *encryptor.py* was used to encrypt a string message into multiple layers of *binary* and *base64*.

2. *compressor.py* was used to zip a file multiple times.
