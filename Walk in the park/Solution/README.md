# Solution

### Description

To obtain the solution, follow the steps:

1. Find a hidden `RAR` in the image (can use *binwalk*).

2. Extract the `RAR` from the image (hex values between `Rar` and `pAD`).

3. Reconstruct the image to learn the password to the rar file.

4. Extract *flag.txt* from the archive.

5. Find the flag (band with *link* in their name) -> *Linkinpark*

### Extras

1. *flag.txt* is the file with the band.

2. *flag.rar* is the archive.

3. *valentinepark.png* is the original image (with the password).
